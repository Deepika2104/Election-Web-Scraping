This project involves the scraping of information from the election results website. The module used to scrap the information from the website is Beautiful Soup and requests.
The information is scraped from the website: https://results.eci.gov.in/
The tables given in the website is scraped and many insights can be made from it. I have made separate tables for the parliament constituencies and assembly constituencies. There are separate tables for Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP), Indian National Congress(INC),  Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam(DMK) and Telugu Desam(TDP) and I have done the analysis for them.
To ease the understanding I have used data visualization tools to create graphs and charts and provide insights.
From the information given in the website I have made the following insights:
- BJP has won more than 40% of the seats.
- BJP has a higher number of chance of winning in Malkajgiri than in Chittorgarh since the total votes in that area is high.
- The that margin in Jaipur is less and hence BJP has more chances winning in Jaipur for the next election, but the margin is the highest in Indore, which means there is less chance of BJP winning in Indore for the next elections.
- The alliance of DMK with INC has increased their winning contituencies.
- This shows the margin of BJP and INC and the difference is very huge which shows that BJP has more power in most of the areas and they are very likely to win the next elections.
- BJP has not won in any of the constituencies in Tamilnadu and Kerala.
- The margin in Dharmapuri, Kallakurichi, Namakkal and Salem are quite low and hence DMK have chances of loosing in these contituencies in the next election.
- New entrants were able to win few seats in the election.
- The power of Telugu Desam(TDP) in the general election to assembly constituencies is higher than BJP.
- The margin of Telugu Desam and BJP is not even close and hence BJP has very less chances of winning in this area.
- BJP has more power in the northern part of India than the southern part of India.
